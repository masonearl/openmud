# Rockmud Roadmap

## Phase 1: Web Version (Current Focus)

Get the web version working well before building native/mobile apps.

- [ ] Settings & codebook upload (labor, equipment, materials)
- [ ] Wire Python tools to chat (real tool calling with user rates)
- [ ] Invoice generator
- [ ] Takeoff calculator
- [ ] Document content extraction (PDF text → model context)
- [ ] Additional tools: change orders, bid comparison, RFIs

## Phase 2: Integrations

- [ ] **Notion integration** – Hook up Notion via MCP or API so users can sync projects, rates, and bid data. Pull codebooks from Notion databases, push estimates/proposals back. *Down the road.*

## Phase 3: Native / Mobile App

- [ ] Build app version after web is solid
- [ ] TBD based on web learnings
