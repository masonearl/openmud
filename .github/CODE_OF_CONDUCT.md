# Code of Conduct

## The short version

openmud is built by and for construction people. Be direct, be helpful, be respectful. Share what you know. Don't be a jerk.

## The longer version

### Who this is for

This community includes contractors, estimators, PMs, field engineers, and developers. Many contributors know more about trenching and pipe sizing than they do about GitHub. That's a feature, not a bug. Respect field knowledge as much as code knowledge.

### Expected behavior

- Share real knowledge — pricing data, field experience, engineering judgment
- Give specific, constructive feedback on PRs and issues
- Welcome people who are new to open source but expert in construction
- Acknowledge when you're wrong or when someone else's approach is better
- Keep discussions focused on making the tools more useful and accurate

### Not acceptable

- Dismissing field knowledge because someone isn't a developer
- Sharing inaccurate pricing or engineering data without noting uncertainty
- Harassment, personal attacks, or discriminatory language of any kind
- Intentionally submitting bad data that could cause someone to underbid a job

### Reporting

If someone's behavior is making the community hostile, email **hi@masonearl.com**. We'll handle it.

### Enforcement

Violations may result in removal from discussions, PR review blocks, or being banned from the project. We want to keep this a place where both field people and developers feel welcome to contribute.
